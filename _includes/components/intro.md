I'm a versatile graphics developer from the heart of Europe -- Stuttgart, Germany.
My main focus is in real-time rendering, with the bulk of my personal work being found in my [renderer](https://github.com/rtryan98/renderer) and it's [rendering hardware interface](https://github.com/rtryan98/rhi).

Most of my programming proficiency is in C/C++.
Beyond that, I am versed in several real-time rendering techniques as well as Vulkan and DirectX 12.

Outside of programming, I have a high interest in quite a lot of different topics, ranging from urbanism and city planning to learning about the history of the world.
With this being said, I think it should also be clear that I quite enjoy Paradox' Grand Strategy games.
